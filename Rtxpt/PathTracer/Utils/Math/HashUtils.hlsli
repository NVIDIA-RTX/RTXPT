/** Generates a pair of 32-bit pseudorandom numbers based on a pair of 32-bit values.

    The code uses a 64-bit block cipher, the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) by Wheeler et al., 1994.
    The 128-bit key is fixed and adapted from here: https://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/webcl/mc.htm.
    This function can be useful for seeding other pseudorandom number generators.

    \param[in] v0 The first value (low dword of the block).
    \param[in] v1 The second value (high dword of the block).
    \param[in] iterations Number of iterations (the authors recommend 16 at a minimum).
    \return Two pseudorandom numbers (the block cipher of (v0,v1)).
