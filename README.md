# RTX Path Tracing v1.5.1

![Title](./Docs/r-title.png)


## Overview

RTX Path Tracing is a code sample that strives to embody years of ray tracing and neural graphics research and experience. It is intended as a starting point for a path tracer integration, as a reference for various integrated SDKs, and/or for learning and experimentation.

The base path tracing implementation derives from NVIDIAâ€™s [Falcor Research Path Tracer](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Falcor), ported to approachable C++/HLSL [Donut framework](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/donut).

GTC presentation [How to Build a Real-time Path Tracer](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/session-catalog/?tab.catalogallsessionstab=16566177511100015Kus&search.industry=option_1559593201839#/session/1666651593475001NN25) provides a high level introduction to most of the features.


## Features

* DirectX 12 and Vulkan back-ends
* Reference and real-time modes
* Simple BSDF model that is easy(ish) to extend
* Simple asset pipeline based on glTF 2.0 (support for a subset of glTF extensions including animation)

* NEE lighting with feedback-based, temporaly adaptive importance sampling
* Basic path tracing features scuh as: Low-discrepancy sample generator based on [Practical Hash-based Owen Scrambling](https://jcgt.org/published/0009/04/01/paper.pdf); [RayCones](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2021-04_improved-shader-and-texture-level-detail-using-ray-cones) for texture MIP selection, early ray termination and similar 
* Basic rasterization features such as: Basic TAA, tone mapping, and similar
* Reference mode 'photo-mode screenshot' with basic [OptiX denoiser](https://developer.nvidia.com/optix-denoiser) integration
* [Shader Execution Reordering](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/improve-shader-performance-and-in-game-frame-rates-with-shader-execution-reordering/) for significant increase in execution performance
* [RTXDI](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXDI) integration for ReSTIR DI (light importance sampling) and and ReSTIR GI (indirect lighting)
* [OMM](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/OMM) integration for fast ray traced alpha testing
* [NRD](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/NRD) ReLAX and ReBLUR denoiser integration with up to 3-layer path space decomposition
* [RTXTF](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXTF) integration for Stochastic Texture Filtering
* [Streamline](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Streamline/) integration for DLSS 4.0 (DLSS SR, DLSS AA, DLSS FG & MFG)


## Requirements

- Windows 10 20H1 (version 2004-10.0.19041) or newer
- DXR Capable GPU (DirectX Raytracing 1.1 API, or higher)
- GeForce Game Ready Driver 572.70 or newer
- DirectX 12 or Vulkan API
- CMake v3.14+
- Visual Studio 2022 (v143 build tools) or later with Windows 10 SDK version 10.0.20348.0 or 10.0.26100.0 or later


## Known Issues

* Enabling Vulkan support requires a couple of manual steps, see [below](#building-vulkan)
* SER, OMM and Streamline support on Vulkan is currently work in progress
* Running Vulkan on AMD GPUs may trigger a TDR during TLAS building in scenes with null TLAS instances
* We recommend using *NVIDIA Nsight Graphics* graphics for frame capture and analysis. If using other GPU performance tuning and debugging tools such as *PIX on Windows*, it is advisable to disable NVRHI_WITH_NVAPI and DONUT_WITH_STREAMLINE variables in CMake to avoid compatibility issues. Please note: disabling these settings results in lower performance and missing features
* There is a known issue resulting in LIVE_DEVICE DirectX warnings reported at shutdown when Streamline is enabled in Debug builds
* There is a known issue resulting in black or incorrect transparencies/reflection on some AMD systems with latest drivers; this is being investigated

## Folder Structure

|						| |  
| -						| - |
| /bin					| default CMake folder for binaries and compiled shaders
| /build				| default CMake folder for build files
| /Assets				| models, textures, scene files  
| /Docs					| documentation 
| /External				| external libraries and SDKs, including Donut, Streamline, NRD, RTXDI, and OMM
| /Tools				| optional command line tools (denoiser, texture compressor, etc)
| /Rtxpt				| **RTX Path Tracing core; Sample.cpp/.h/.hlsl contain entry points**
| /Rtxpt/PathTracer		| **Core path tracing shaders**


## Build

At the moment, only Windows builds are fully supported. We are going to add Linux support in the future.

1. Clone the repository **with all submodules recursively**:
   
   `git clone --recursive https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXPT.git`

2. Use CMake to configure the build and generate the project files.
   
   ```
   cd RTXPT
   cmake CMakeLists.txt -B ./build
   ```

   Use `-G "some tested VS version"` if specific Visual Studio or other environment version required. Make sure the x64 platform is used. 

3. Build the solution generated by CMake in the `./build/` folder.

   In example, if using Visual Studio, open the generated solution `build/RTXPathTracing.sln` and build it.

4. Select and run the `rtxpt` project. Binaries get built to the `bin` folder. Assets/media are loaded from `assets` folder.

   If making a binary build, the `assets` and `tools` folders can be placed into `bin` next to executable and packed up together (i.e. the sample app will search for both `Assets/` and `../Assets/`).


## Building Vulkan

Due to interaction with various included libraries, Vulkan support is not enabled by default and needs a couple of additional tweaks on the user side; please find the recommended steps below:
 * Install Vulkan SDK (we tested with VulkanSDK-1.3.290.0) and clear CMake cache (if applicable) to make sure the correct dxc.exe path from Vulkan SDK is set for SPIRV compilation
 * Set DONUT_WITH_VULKAN and NVRHI_WITH_VULKAN CMake variables to ON. DXC_SPIRV_PATH should already have automatically picked up the location of the DXC compiler in the Vulkan SDK during config; if not, please set it manually
 * Disable streamline integration by setting DONUT_WITH_STREAMLINE CMake variable to OFF
 * To run with Vulkan use `--vk` command line parameter
 

 ## User Interface

Once the application is running, most of the SDK features can be accessed via the UI window on the left hand side and drop-down controls in the top-center. 

![UI](./Docs/r-ui.png)

Camera can be moved using W/S/A/D keys and rotated by dragging with the left mouse cursor.


## Command Line

- `--scene` loads a specific .scene.json file; example: `--scene programmer-art.scene.json`
- `--width` and `--height` to set the window size; example: `--width 3840 --height 2160`
- `--fullscreen` to start in full screen mode; example: `--width 3840 --height 2160 --fullscreen`
- `--debug` to enable the graphics API debug layer or runtime, and additional validation layers.
- `--vk` to enable Vulkan (see [building-vulkan](#building-vulkan))
